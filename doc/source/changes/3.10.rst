v3.10
======
qibuild
--------

* Include test dependencies in ``<build>/dependencies.cmake``
  This allows you to declare ``gtest`` as a ``testtime`` dependency only.
  (No need for it to be a ``buildtime`` dependency)

qipy
-----

* ``qipy bootstrap``: prettier output

qisrc
-----

* Fix using relative paths with ``qisrc init``
* ``qisrc push``: When the project is not under code review,
  warn and ask the user if he is sure before running ``git push``.
  You can use the ``-y`` option to disable this check.

qitoolchain
-----------

* ``qitoolchain convert-package``: Properly raises an ``NotImplementedError``
  when used with an ``.rpm`` file
